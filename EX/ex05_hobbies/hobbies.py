        running
        walking
    Mary has:
        dancing
        running
    Nora has:
        running
        singing
        dancing

    Pairs and corresponding common and different hobbies; ratio
    John and Mary; common: running; diff: walking, dancing; ratio: 1/2
    John and Nora; common: running; diff: walking, singing, dancing; ratio: 1/3
    Mary and Nora; common: running, dancing; diff: singing; ratio: 2/1

    So the best result is Mary and Nora. It doesn't matter in which order the names are returned.

    If multiple pairs have the same best ratio, it doesn't matter which pair is returned.

    The exception is when multiple pairs share all of their hobbies, in which case the pair with
    the most shared hobbies is returned.

    A pair with only common hobbies is better than any other pair with at least 1 different hobby.

    Example:
    John has:
        running
        walking
    Mary has:
        running
        walking
    Nora has:
        running
    Oprah has:
        running
    Albert has:
        tennis
        basketball
        football
    Xena has:
        tennis
        basketball
        football
        dancing

    John and Mary have 2 common, 0 different. Ratio 2/0
    Nora and Mary (also Nora and John, Oprah and John, Oprah and Mary) have 1 common, 1 different. Ratio 1/1
    Nora and Oprah have 1 common, 0 different. Ratio 1/0
    Albert and Xena have 3 common, 1 different. Ratio 3/1

    In that case the best pair is John and Mary. If the number of different hobbies is 0,
    then this is better than any pair with at least 1 different hobby.
    Out of the pairs with 0 different hobbies, the one with the highest number
    of common hobbies is the best.
    If there are multiple pairs with the highes number of common hobbies,
    any pair (and in any order) is accepted.

    If there are less than 2 people in the input, return None.
